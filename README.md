## 🎭 Game Rules

### Basic Concept

Werewolf (also called Mafia) is a deduction game where:
- **Good Team** (Villagers, Doctor, Detective) tries to identify and eliminate the Werewolves
- **Evil Team** (Werewolves) secretly eliminates Good players at night

### Game Structure

**Total Players: 8**
- Good Team: 5 (4 Villagers, 1 Doctor, 1 Detective)
- Evil Team: 2 (2 Werewolves)

### Game Phases

#### 🌞 DAY Phase
1. All living players are shown
2. AI players discuss and accuse each other
3. All players vote on who to eliminate
4. Player with most votes is removed from game
5. Role is revealed
6. Points awarded based on whether eliminated player was good or evil

#### 🌙 NIGHT Phase
1. Werewolves secretly choose a Good player to eliminate
2. Doctor (if alive) can protect one player
3. Detective (if alive) can investigate one player's role
4. Results are shown the next morning
5. Phase transitions to DAY

### Win Conditions

- **Good Team Wins:** All Werewolves are eliminated
- **Evil Team Wins:** Werewolves equal or outnumber Good players

## 🚀 Installation

### Requirements
- **Python 3.7 or higher**
- **Tkinter** (included with most Python installations)
- **Linux, macOS, or Windows** (tested on Fedora)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Parag1337/WereWolf-AI-Game.git
cd WereWolf-AI-Game
```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)

**On Linux/macOS:**
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or if no requirements file:
```bash
# No external dependencies needed - uses only Python standard library
# Make sure Tkinter is installed (python3-tk on Linux)
```

### Step 4: Add Game Assets (Optional)

The game looks for images in the `assets/` folder:
- `dayBackground.png` or `dayBackround.png` - Day phase background
- `nightBackground.png` or `nightBackround.png` - Night phase background
- `villager.png` - Villager avatar
- `werewolf.png` - Werewolf avatar
- `bonefire.png` - Bonfire decoration

## 🤖 How AI Works

### Suspicion System

Each AI player maintains two metrics for every other player:

**Suspicion Score (0-1):**
- Increases when player's vote seems wrong
- Increases when voting patterns look coordinated
- Increases when statements contradict previous behavior
- Used to identify likely Werewolves

**Trust Score (0-1):**
- Starts at 0.5 (neutral)
- Increases for consistent, honest-seeming behavior
- Decreases for suspicious behavior
- Used to weight voting decisions

### AI Decision Making

When voting, each AI player:

1. **Analyzes all players** using suspicion/trust scores
2. **Filters candidates** - won't vote for obviously trusted players
3. **Ranks by suspicion** - most suspicious players voted first
4. **Generates dialogue** - explains their reasoning
5. **Casts vote** - based on calculated most-suspicious player

### Role-Specific Behavior

**Werewolf AI:**
- Tries to eliminate key Good players (Doctor, Detective first)
- Votes suspiciously to hide identity
- High suspicion of players who vote against werewolf team
- Defensive statements when accused

**Doctor AI:**
- Prioritizes protecting high-value targets
- Tracks threat patterns
- Uses voting information to deduce Werewolf locations
- Strategic about who to protect

**Detective AI:**
- Investigates most suspicious players first
- Uses confirmed roles to narrow down Werewolves
- Votes based on investigation results
- More confident in their voting after investigation

**Villager AI:**
- Uses voting and speech analysis only
- Builds suspicion through pattern matching
- Learns from revealed roles
- Adjusts strategy as game progresses

## 🛠️ Development

### Project Statistics
- **Lines of Code:** 1500+
- **Python Version:** 3.7+
- **Main Dependencies:** Tkinter (built-in), Python Standard Library
- **Architecture:** Object-oriented with AI pattern recognition

### Code Organization
- **ui.py** - GUI and rendering (Tkinter Canvas)
- **engine.py** - Game logic and AI decision-making
- **models.py** - Data structures (Enum, Dataclass)
- **animations.py** - Animation classes and effects
- **config.py** - Constants and configuration
- **utils.py** - Helper functions (asset loading, math)
- **main.py** - Entry point

### Key Algorithms
1. **Suspicion Calculation** - Weighted scoring based on player behavior
2. **Vote Aggregation** - Finds most-suspected player via Counter
3. **AI Dialogue Generation** - Template-based with player substitution
4. **Animation Interpolation** - Smooth transitions using easing functions

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Asset images are optional (game runs with placeholder colors if missing)
- AI dialogue is template-based (for performance)
- Canvas rendering may lag on very old systems
- Tkinter canvas can be slow with many simultaneous animations

### Troubleshooting

**"No module named 'tkinter'"**
```bash
# Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt-get install python3-tk

# Linux (Fedora)
sudo dnf install python3-tkinter

# macOS
brew install python-tk

# Windows - Reinstall Python with "tcl/tk and IDLE" checked
```

**Game window doesn't appear**
- Ensure X11 is running (on Linux with remote connection)
- Check if Tkinter is properly installed
- Try running in a different virtual environment

**No images showing**
- Add PNG files to `assets/` folder
- Check `config.py` for correct asset paths
- Game will still run without images (uses colored backgrounds)
